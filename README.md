# KrunkerCSS
How to use a Krunker CSS:

1) Download a CSS which you like. Take note that CSS's only work in Krunker clients and not in Browser's like the one im using: Firefox.
2) Rename the css file as Main_Custom and drag it into the downloads folder first
3) If your app/client you are using such as NullClient or idkr client has a css folder, drag the css into the folder
4) Now just open the application and see if the css is working!
